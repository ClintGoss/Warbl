## Overview

The Warbl is an electronic wind instrument designed and produced by Andrew Mowry in Oregon, USA.
The Warbl Font Folio is a collection of free fonts with fingering diagrams for the Warbl electronic wind instrument.

The OpenType / TrueType fonts are specifically intended for authors who are writing documents related to the Warbl,
such as engraving sheet music and authoring educational material.
The fonts are particularly useful for people who use Microsoft Word to publish PDF documents.

In addition to being useful for normal text, the fonts have finger diagrams for all possible combinations
of open and closed finger holes on the Warbl instrument, as well as a broad range of additional characters for
typesetting music.
Each font has both vertical and horizontal finger diagrams.
